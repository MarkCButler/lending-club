# Analysis and machine learning: LendingClub

The work is presented in a series of Jupyter notebooks that have been converted to HTML.
Links to these notebooks are labelled below with the Jupyter icon :jupyter-colored:.

!!! warning "Browser compatibility"

    The converted notebooks are best viewed using the Chrome browser.  The HTML files
    generated by Jupyter's [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) tool include
    some features that do not render correctly in Firefox. Compatibility with other browsers
    has not been tested.

## Data cleaning

The LendingClub [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)
includes data on accepted and rejected loans from 2007 through 2018 Q2.

<!--
    In this document, relative links to html files such as
        html/data-cleaning-01.html
    point to Jupyter notebooks that have been converted to html.  The html directory
    containing these converted notebooks is ignored by git in the main branch (due
    to the .gitignore file).  However, this directory is not ignored by the static
    site generator mkdocs-material.  The site published to branch gh-pages therefore
    includes the html directory.

    Note that the command to publish the repo's site is
        poetry run mkdocs gh-deploy --no-history --strict

### [:jupyter-colored: Define data types and reformat data](html/data-cleaning-01.html)

- After preliminary exploration of the data, define a data type for each feature.
- Convert / reformat some columns to facilitate model development.
- Create a SQLite database.

### [:jupyter-colored: Filter columns and rows](html/data-cleaning-02.html)

- Explore features in preparation for filtering.
- Filter out certain columns and rows from the data on accepted loans.
- Update the database, including only the filtered data on accepted loans.

## Feature exploration

### [:jupyter-colored: Classify features](html/feature-classification-01.html)

- Explore features for which the classification is initially unclear.
- Group all features for accepted loans based on the following:
    1. Type of information (e.g., information about the borrower or the loan)
    2. Whether the information is known at loan origination
- Update the database to include feature classification.
