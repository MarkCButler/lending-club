\[Work in progress, currently far from complete\]

Analysis and machine learning models of a
[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club) from LendingClub

The work is presented in a series of Jupyter notebooks that have been converted to HTML.
An overview with links to converted notebooks is available at

https://markcbutler.github.io/lending-club/

Note that the converted notebooks are best viewed using the Chrome browser.  The HTML
files generated by Jupyter's [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) tool
include some features that do not render correctly in Firefox. Compatibility with other
browsers has not been tested.
